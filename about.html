        <h1>About CropSmart AI</h1>
        <p>CropSmart AI is an intelligent crop yield prediction tool created to assist farmers, agronomists, and agricultural planners in making data-driven decisions to optimize harvest outcomes. This application utilizes key environmental data—such as pesticide usage, temperature, and rainfall—to estimate the expected crop yield.</p>

        <p>It was first conceptualized, developed, and tested on <strong>17 April 2025</strong>. The main goal of CropSmart AI is to reduce uncertainty in agriculture by giving users an easy-to-use interface to forecast productivity based on real-time or historical data.</p>

        <p>Farmers often face challenges like unpredictable weather patterns, inefficient use of resources, and lack of accessible insights to inform their practices. CropSmart AI addresses these problems by providing an intuitive system that leverages environmental data inputs to generate reliable yield predictions, helping users increase efficiency, plan better, and make smarter farming decisions.</p>

        <p>We believe that integrating technology into agriculture is a key step toward food security, sustainable farming, and improved livelihoods for rural communities. CropSmart AI is a step in that direction—bridging the gap between innovation and everyday agricultural practice.</p>
